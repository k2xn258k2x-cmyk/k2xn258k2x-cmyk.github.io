VaultBook is built for people who want a calm workspace that stays fast, searchable, and under their control.

## What you can do in one session

- Create a project page
- Attach your files
- Add a handful of tags
- Search across everything
- Save a tidy summary for later

## Why offline-first matters

When your library is local, the experience stays consistent. You can keep working during travel, during outages, and in places where privacy matters.
